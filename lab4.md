# 2 — Importance of License

It is important to choose a license because otherwise other users may not know what they are and are permitted to do with it. This may result in users not complying with every condition you'd like to impose for using your code; for example, they may not know to provide credit to you as the original owner. Furthermore, for reasons defined in part 3, users may be wary of code that lacks a license, meaning people may be slow to adopt your code when you want them to use it.
