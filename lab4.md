# 2 — Importance of License

It is important to choose a license because otherwise other users may not know what they are and are permitted to do with it. This may result in users not complying with every condition you'd like to impose for using your code; for example, they may not know to provide credit to you as the original owner. Furthermore, for reasons defined in part 3, users may be wary of code that lacks a license, meaning people may be slow to adopt your code when you want them to use it.

# 3 — Why Note Use Project w/o License

One should avoid using software that does not have an explicit license attached because the original owner may attach a license to it at any time without informing you; therefore, you may accidentally end up violating the license without knowing. This produces a significant degree of risk and introduces another unknown variable into your project, which is highly undesireable.

# 5 — Justify License

Linux uses a GPL license because it is a subset of the GNU project, whose goal is to provide an operating system using entirely free software ([source](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html)). Given this, it makes sense that Linux would use a license created by the free software foundation to guarantee that a piece of software remains free.
