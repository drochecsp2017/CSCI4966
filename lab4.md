# 2 — Importance of License

It is important to choose a license because otherwise other users may not know what they are and are permitted to do with it. This may result in users not complying with every condition you'd like to impose for using your code; for example, they may not know to provide credit to you as the original owner. Furthermore, for reasons defined in part 3, users may be wary of code that lacks a license, meaning people may be slow to adopt your code when you want them to use it.

# 3 — Why Note Use Project w/o License

One should avoid using software that does not have an explicit license attached because the original owner may attach a license to it at any time without informing you; therefore, you may accidentally end up violating the license without knowing. This produces a significant degree of risk and introduces another unknown variable into your project, which is highly undesireable. 

# 4 — Reading Opinions

I agree with the author's argument in the article. Many elements of Gopher, from its name to its origin point, almost seemed to conspire to put it in a disadvantageous position until it finally lost currency with the public. The creators of the web were simply better at marketing their protocol and gaining widespread acceptance.

# 5 — Justify License

Linux uses a GPL license because it is a subset of the GNU project, whose goal is to provide an operating system using entirely free software ([source](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html)). Given this, it makes sense that Linux would use a license created by the free software foundation to guarantee that a piece of software remains free.

# 6 — Group License

Our group is using the MIT License, because it is widely used and fairly popular.

# 7 — License Advantages

Developer: The best license is the Apache license, as it only requires including information on the original copyright and license; this puts the least degree of burden on them.

Company: The best license is the Apache license, as it requires including information on the original copyright, thereby protecting their inteelectual property.

Common Good: The best license is the GPL, as it has the largest degree of reproductive freedom, thus increasing the number of good products available.

# 9 — Course Project

For this course, I'd like to get to work on a project that could help students manage their time or money. The project might help with scheduling, or seeing how much money/meal swipes one has left, or perhaps help manage a budget. This is something I personally have some degree of trouble with, so there's probably a good number of other college students that have trouble with it as well. Again, most likely I would like to use an MIT license due to its existing popularity.
