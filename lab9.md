Attempting to execute the files in Example 4 led to a crash in one of docker's files; looks like a path isn't being passed correctly or something? Seeing as none of the files specified in the instructions have anything to do with passing file locations as arguments as far as I can tell, I have no idea why this is happening or where I'd even begin to go about debugging. I assume it has to do with the change in environment (OSX versus Windows), but that only makes me less confident that I'd be able to determine what's going on.
