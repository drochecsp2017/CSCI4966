*Comments*: `gitstats` found only one contributor and a slightly smaller number of lines of code.
Uncertain of why this is, though the former discrepancy could just be that the RCOS page (my source) uses a more generous definition of "contributor".
Likewise, the slight differences in the number of lines of code could just amount to the different ways of counting lines used by `gitstats` and the `git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l` command.

Comments after running gitstat:
	It shows 5 authors but 2 of them are the same people using different user names.
	It only counts 9347 lines... but it has a graph so it must be right?
	It shows the same date for the last commit and first commit
	(cant find branch information)
